# DataScienceCapstoneProject
Capstone project in natural language processing for DataScience specialization

My goal in this capstone is to create an app that predict next word.

First i create a load.R file that download datasets provided by Coursera and split it in two files.
I won't use initial datasets again, and will use training set instead. 
Training set i will explore and train my model on it and test set i will use to understand how accurate my model is.

Then i need to perform some exploratory analysis.

Then i should clean my training set. Remove badwords, becouse i dont want to predict them.
And other bad things which were found in exploratory analysis phase. And use good things.  
It's better to create a function for this. I will use this function later when testing on different sentences.
